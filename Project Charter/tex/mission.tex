To design an open source 3D gaze tracking software solution using off the shelf, fully integrated hardware. We will design this solution using the Intel RealSense SR300 camera. It combines a traditional 2D video camera and a 3D infrared camera designed to work in the sorter ranges expected with PC use. In addition, the Intel RealSense cameras are already integrated into some laptops, allowing our solution to be more readily adopted. 

We will design the system to operate as a visual mouse like virtual device, enabling either the user's eyes to act as a pseudo mouse input, or to act as a selection device that leaves the traditional mouse free for normal use. We will accomplish this using the 3D data provided by the RealSense camera in conjunction with its 2D camera data. Mathematical operations will be performed to isolate a user's eyes and track them in relation to the camera that is setting near the screen. Once calibrated the combination of 3D and 2D inputs will allow the software to follow the users gaze, thereby enabling the input functionality of the software.
