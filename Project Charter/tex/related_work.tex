For the past couple years gaze tracking has been a hot item for researchers.  Previously, the use of a Microsoft Kinect device was used to impose gaze tracking without the use of a full infrared system.  The team at Microsoft Research published an article relating to gaze tracking using feature detection with a Microsoft Kinect.  However, work related to creating a virtual mouse has been mostly proprietary or expensive in assistive technologies.  Because of the optimal distances that are required for a Kinect,  a virtual pointer has only been effective with the use of algorithms to determine selection.
