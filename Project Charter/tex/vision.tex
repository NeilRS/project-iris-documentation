In a world of mice and keyboards we believe a PC input peripheral device is missing, and that device is a 3D gaze tracker. The most expressive part of a human's anatomy is their eyes. They can convey surprise, sadness, joy, and love. With the Project Iris we aim to help them add a new dimension to their capabilities, and in turn add new capability to the PC as well. This will not only enable new user experiences for PCs and software developers, but also enable PC experiences for the disabled and handicapped as well. A group that can find it difficult to interact with current PC technology.

The new experiences created may give greater control in a video game by allowing a user to make selections with their eyes, without shifting hands off the keyboard or changing the mouse's focus. We envision our solution enabling artist to visually switch between tools in paint programs by allowing them to look at the tool they wish to use, rather than taking their hand away from their artwork. For a musician, switching backing tracks or audio effects between songs is currently clunky, but we believe by using their vision they can adjust their tools, without taking their hands off their instruments. More importantly we believe that we don't know all the possibilities this software may have, which is why we want it to be open source, to allow others with a vision to expand upon ours.
