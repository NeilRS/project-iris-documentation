For Project Iris to be considered a success it must be complete and working by The end of the 2016 fall semester.  The camera will track the gaze of the eye and a user will have the ability to view the position of their eyes visually on screen.  The project will make available an API where-by developers may integrate eye position data into their projects. The project will also provide a toggle via API calls to enable on-screen display of the current eye position. Additionally a calibration utility and a camera output data visualization utility will be provided.
